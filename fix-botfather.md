# ðŸ¤– Fix BotFather Menu Button

## The Problem
Your bot shows "Temporary URL" instead of your games on mobile.

## The Solution
You need to update BotFather with your ngrok URL.

## Step-by-Step Fix:

### 1. Open Telegram on your phone
- Find @BotFather
- Send `/mybots`

### 2. Select your bot
- Choose your bot from the list

### 3. Choose "Bot Settings"
- Select "Bot Settings"
- Then select "Menu Button"

### 4. Send your ngrok URL
```
https://5a6fdd935cb2.ngrok-free.app
```

### 5. Test your bot
- Go to your bot
- Send `/start`
- Click the game buttons

## Alternative: Use Bot Commands
Instead of menu button, your bot also has these commands:
- `/playbingo` - Play Bingo games

- `/register` - Register account
- `/balance` - Check balance

## If Still Not Working:

1. **Restart your bot backend:**
```bash
# Stop bot (Ctrl+C) then:
npm start
```

2. **Check all services are running:**
- Backend: http://localhost:3001
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000  
- ngrok: https://5a6fdd935cb2.ngrok-free.app

3. **Clear Telegram cache:**
- Close Telegram app completely
- Reopen and try again

## Test Commands:
Try these in your bot chat:
- `/start`
- `/playbingo`


These should work even if menu button doesn't!
