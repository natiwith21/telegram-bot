# 📊 HISTORY FEATURE FIXED

## ✅ Problem Solved

The History tab was showing "Previous games will appear here" instead of actual game history. Now it's fully functional!

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Added Game History State**
```javascript
const [gameHistory, setGameHistory] = useState([]); // Store user's game history
```

### 2. **Updated loadUserData Function**
- Now extracts `gameHistory` from the API response
- Logs the number of games loaded
- Sets the game history state

### 3. **Enhanced History Tab Display**

### 4. **Interactive Features**
