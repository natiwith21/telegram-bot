BALANCE SYNC FIX - QUICK SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
  The game shows "⚠️ Unable to sync balance with server" even with good internet

ROOT CAUSE:
  Frontend was trying to call API on frontend URL instead of backend URL
  - When environment variable VITE_BACKEND_URL was not set
  - It fell back to window.location.origin (the frontend page URL)
  - This caused 404 errors on all API calls

WHAT WAS FIXED:
  
  1. frontend/src/utils/api.js
     - Changed fallback from window.location.origin to hardcoded production URL
     - Now: window.origin → https://telegram-bot-u2ni.onrender.com
  
  2. frontend/src/pages/LikeBingo.jsx
     - Fixed loadUserData() function to use correct backend URL
     - Fixed processGameResult() function to use correct backend URL
     - Fixed test API button to use correct backend URL
  
  3. frontend/.env.example
     - Created documentation for VITE_BACKEND_URL environment variable

HOW TO APPLY THE FIX:
  
  Step 1: Make sure frontend/.env contains:
    VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://telegram-bot-u2ni.onrender.com
  
  Step 2: Rebuild frontend
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run build
  
  Step 3: Push to GitHub and Render will auto-deploy

VERIFICATION:
  
  ✓ Game loads without "Unable to sync" warning
  ✓ Browser console shows: "✅ Found user with balance"
  ✓ Game balance updates correctly after win/loss
  ✓ Console shows: "Backend URL: https://telegram-bot-u2ni.onrender.com"

FILES CHANGED:
  - frontend/src/utils/api.js (modified)
  - frontend/src/pages/LikeBingo.jsx (modified)
  - frontend/.env.example (created)
  - BALANCE_SYNC_FIX_2025.md (created - detailed guide)

The fix is complete and ready to deploy!
